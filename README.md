## <a name="demo-documentation"></a> Demo & Documentation
üì∫ [DEMO](https://kevinmidboe.com/request)  
üìù Documentation of the api.  
üíñ Checkout my [fancy vue.js page](https://github.com/KevinMidboe/seasonedRequest) for interfacing the api.  

## <a name="about"></a> About
This is the backend api for [seasoned request] that allows for uesrs to request movies and shows by fetching movies from themoviedb api and checks them with your plex library to identify if a movie is already present or not. This api allows to search my query, get themoviedb movie lists like popular and now playing, all while checking if the item is already in your plex library. Your friends can create users to see what movies or shows they have requested and searched for.   

The api also uses torrent_search to search for matching torrents and returns results from any site or service available from torrent_search. As a admin of the site you can query torrent_search and return a magnet link that can be added to a autoadd folder of your favorite torrent client.

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation
Before we can use seasonedShows we need to download node and a package manager. For instructions on how to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package managers refer to [wiki: install package manager](https://github.com/KevinMidboe/seasonedShows/wiki/Install-package-manager). This api is written with express using node.js as the JavaScript runtime engine. To download node.js head over the the official [node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Install seasonedShows
After you have downloaded a package manager and node.js javascript engine, the following will guide you through how to download, install and run seasonedShows.

### Requirements
 - Node 7.6 < [wiki page]
 - Plex library

## <a name="setup"></a> Setup and/ configuration
There is a config file template, what the values mean and how to change them. 
Also show how to hide file from git if not want to show up as uncommitted file. 
Also set variables in environment.

## <a name="running"></a> Running/using
yarn/npm start. (can also say this above)
How to create service on linux. This means that 

## <a name="daemon"></a> Setup a daemon
The next step is to setup seasonedShows api to run in the background as a daemon. I have written a [wiki page](https://github.com/KevinMidboe/seasonedShows/wiki/Install-as-a-daemon) on how to create a daemon on several unix distors and macOS.

## Api documentation


The goal of this project is to create a full custom stack that can to everything surround downloading, organizing and notifiyng of new media. From the top down we have a website using [tmdb](https://www.themoviedb.com) api to search for from over 350k movies and 70k tv shows. Using [hjone72](https://github.com/hjone72/PlexAuth) great PHP reverse proxy we can have a secure way of allowing users to login with their plex credentials which limits request capabilites to only users that are authenticated to use your plex library. 
seasonedShows is a intelligent organizer for your tv show episodes. It is made to automate and simplify to process of renaming and moving newly downloaded tv show episodes following Plex file naming and placement. 

So this is a multipart system that lets your plex users request movies, and then from the admin page the owner can.

## Installation
There are two main ways of 

## Architecture
The flow of the system will first check for new folders in your tv shows directory, if a new file is found it's contents are analyzed, stored and tweets suggested changes to it's contents to use_admin.

Then there is a script for looking for replies on twitter by user_admin, if caanges are needed, it handles the changes specified and updates dtabbase.

After approval by user the files are modified and moved to folders in resptected area. If error occours, pasteee link if log is sent to user.
