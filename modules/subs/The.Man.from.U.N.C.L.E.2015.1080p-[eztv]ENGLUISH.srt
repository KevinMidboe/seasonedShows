1
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,368
You look important.

2
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,568
Or, at least, your suit does.

3
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,366
Well, I can get you over the Wall.

4
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,291
Would you consider that important,
<i>Fräulein</i> Schmidt?

5
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,484
A smart mouth to go with the suit.

6
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,689
Statements like that can get you
into a lot of trouble around here.

7
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,808
Or they can get you out of it.

8
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,723
Make yourself comfortable, why don't you.

9
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,007
Okay, Mr. Important-Suit.
Who are you and what do you want?

10
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,924
I'm here to have a chat about your father.

11
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,161
I don't have a father.

12
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,846
I don't mean your late foster father,
the mechanic.

13
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,604
I mean your real father.

14
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,486
Dr. Udo Teller.

15
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,287
- Hitler's favorite rocket scientist.
- That doesn't sound very friendly.

16
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,446
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen him for 18 years.

17
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,688
Well, after the war,
he came to work for us.

18
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,524
He'd been enjoying the American dream.

19
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,842
Had a great job working
for the U.S. Nuclear Program...

20
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,002
...pleasant house in the suburbs...

21
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,642
...a new Cadillac and a fat little dog
called "Schnitzel."

22
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,522
Then, two years ago, he disappeared
like steam from a tea kettle.

23
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,126
Until now.
This was taken last week in Rome.

24
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,482
Which one is supposed to be my father?

25
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,767
Funny.

26
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,169
I'm told that if your father's knowledge
gets into the wrong hands...

27
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,288
...things could get a little messy.

28
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,011
You know, end of the world.
That kind of thing.

29
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,810
What makes you think
I know where he is?

30
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,691
I don't think you do, but I think
you know someone who does.

31
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,887
Your mother's brother:

32
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,565
Uncle Rudi.

33
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,401
I've also been told
that your father was never...

34
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,884
...actually a Nazi.

35
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,883
He was forced to work for them.

36
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,526
So I'm here to help him.

37
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,364
- Why don't you help me.
- With what?

38
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,569
If I had 15 minutes,
we'd drink tea, eat biscuits...

39
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,166
...I'd talk, you'd laugh,
and we'd be on our way.

40
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,084
Unfortunately, I don't.

41
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,287
So my offer is come with me now...

42
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,683
...and be at a chic little hotel
in West Berlin in less than an hour.

43
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,611
Or stay here and spend the night
with the Russians...

44
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,081
...hanging from a pipe,
having your toenails removed.

45
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,765
That is what I was looking for.

46
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,283
Do you mind terribly if I borrow your car?

47
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,609
Could you pass me that brown paper bag
from my case, please?

48
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,887
Are they still following us?

49
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,727
Yes.

50
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,801
Is there one of them?

51
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,326
Just hum if there is.

52
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,690
- Mm-hm.
- Is he looking at us?

53
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,645
Mm.

54
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,483
Does he have just one hand
on the steering wheel?

55
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,011
Mm-hm.

56
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,686
When you hear something
that sounds like a gunshot...

57
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,970
...drive.

58
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,846
Did you get him?

59
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,162
Let's hope he doesn't drive
as quickly as he moves.

60
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,124
I got news for you. He does.

61
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,526
Make a right.

62
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,810
And then an immediate left.

63
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,801
Nicely done.

64
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,846
Hold on.

65
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,567
Is he gone?

66
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,925
You know, I don't think so.

67
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,411
Reverse down the sidewalk...

68
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,285
...then drive around the block.

69
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,201
And, uh, meet me back here.

70
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,130
You should look out the window.

71
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,249
You can't be serious.

72
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,120
He's trying to stop the car.

73
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,286
We're struggling here.

74
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,044
Why don't you take a shot at him.

75
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,803
Somehow it just doesn't seem like
the right thing to do.

76
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,810
First left, then immediate right.

77
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,168
- This road isn't going anywhere.
- It's taking us where we want to go.

78
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,200
- It's getting narrower.
- All part of the plan.

79
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,123
Put your foot down
and drive a little faster.

80
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,321
Good plan.

81
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,006
<i>All we have to do is get over
two 20-foot walls and a minefield.</i>

82
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,247
Now what?

83
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,003
Take another left through the window.

84
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,601
After you.

85
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,811
Follow me.

86
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,562
What are we doing here?

87
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,530
We're looking for Agent Jones.

88
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,927
Hug me.

89
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,964
Jones, reverse!

90
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,085
Step back.

91
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,162
This place isn't chic.

92
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,362
It isn't even a hotel.

93
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,364
No. But it's safer.
And the food isn't bad.

94
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,288
What's that? Smells like feet.

95
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,169
Expensive feet.

96
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,041
He's here.

97
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,328
<i>Our commitment
to defend Western Europe...</i>

98
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,289
<i>...and West Berlin, for example...</i>

99
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,204
<i>...stands undiminished.</i>

100
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,409
<i>The United States will make no deal
with the Soviet Union...</i>

101
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,688
<i>...because the communist drive...</i>

102
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,487
<i>...to impose their political
and economic system on others...</i>

103
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,366
<i>...is the primary cause
of world tension today.</i>

104
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,608
I trust that Miss Teller was helpful.

105
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,162
You were right. The uncle,
Rudolph Von Trulsch, is the best shot.

106
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,727
That's it? That's all you got?

107
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,450
He lives in Italy. Rome.

108
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,807
Works for a shipping company
called Vinciguerra.

109
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,406
And now you have Miss Teller.
My work here is done.

110
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,289
We already knew all that.

111
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,480
Your job here is done
when I tell you it's done.

112
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,689
You told me, this was gonna be
a simple extraction.

113
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
It should have been.

114
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,686
I didn't ask you
to light up half of East Berlin.

115
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,370
They were waiting for me.

116
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,568
Don't flatter yourself.
They follow everybody.

117
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,683
What was waiting for me
was barely human.

118
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,171
You should've seen it run.

119
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,810
Grow a spine, Solo.

120
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,522
Contrary to what you may think,
we are not in the haberdashery business.

121
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,365
I don't think you understand.
It tore the back off my car.

122
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,610
Remind me, Solo.
How long was your prison sentence?

123
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,082
You owe me five more years.

124
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,008
Now, I know you've been...

125
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,441
...taking care of yourself on the side.

126
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,080
You're wetting your beak, so to speak.

127
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,290
We don't pay you enough to be able
to put truffles in your risotto, Solo.

128
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,521
But don't ever make
the calamitous error...

129
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,129
...of mistaking my deliberate
short-sightedness for blindness.

130
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,882
Now, you report for duty tomorrow morning,
9 a.m. sharp.

131
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,731
And with a better attitude.

132
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,726
Look at them.

133
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,929
Merrily oblivious as we labor tirelessly...

134
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,323
...to save them from extinction
and not even a thank you.

135
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,609
I tell myself, Solo...

136
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,242
...that inside every Kraut,
there's an American trying to get out.

137
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,009
A little tired this morning, sir?

138
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,642
You'd be too if you'd been up
all night trying to sort this mess out.

139
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,008
Anything in particular, sir, or...?

140
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,002
Or are you just looking?

141
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,647
What I'm about to feed you, Solo,
might taste a little bitter.

142
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,165
Nevertheless, you're gonna have
to swallow it.

143
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,760
Where are we going with this?

144
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,327
Adrian.

145
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,563
Kuryakin.

146
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,765
What does that mean?

147
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,407
He said,
"Don't kill your partner on your first day."

148
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,801
I know what he said.

149
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,088
What does it mean?

150
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,563
The main ingredient
of an atom bomb is enriched uranium.

151
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,082
Dr. Teller was on the verge
of a breakthrough...

152
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,447
...which would massively simplify
this process.

153
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,889
Making it possible for almost anyone
to build a nuclear device.

154
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,402
We believe that the Vinciguerra
Shipping and Aerospace Company in Rome...

155
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,281
...where Miss Teller's Uncle Rudi
is a senior executive...

156
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,128
...is, in fact, the cover for an
international criminal organization...

157
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,725
...with ties to former Nazis.

158
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,206
The founder, Sergio Vinciguerra, was
a friend of Mussolini and a known fascist.

159
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,407
Rumor has it...

160
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,609
...Sergio was responsible
for smuggling the Nazis' gold...

161
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,450
...to South America after the war.

162
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,329
It is now run by his son, Alexander,
and his wife, Victoria.

163
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,364
Al, he's more playboy than tycoon.

164
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,927
But she...

165
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,890
Well, now,
she's something else altogether.

166
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,568
All our information indicates
a lethal combination...

167
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,802
...of beauty, brains and ambition.

168
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,730
She's the real fanatic.

169
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,966
Now that the old man is dead...

170
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,642
...she's running the show.

171
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,889
We believe they're responsible
for Dr. Teller's disappearance.

172
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,326
Now...

173
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,931
...imagine the consequences
if he builds an atom bomb for them.

174
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,321
We have no choice
but to work together on this.

175
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,245
Your mission is to infiltrate
this organization...

176
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,971
...and to retrieve Dr. Teller
and his research.

177
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,690
It will be located on a computer disk.

178
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,170
And whoever has that disk...

179
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,368
...will simply be the most powerful nation
in the world.

180
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,530
You, Solo, are to investigate Victoria
and Alexander Vinciguerra.

181
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,447
Our Russian friend will focus
on Miss Teller and her Uncle Rudi.

182
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,531
We'll leave you two to get acquainted.

183
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,285
Oleg.

184
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,008
Give my regards to Nina.

185
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,047
Obviously, I was briefed about you.

186
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,010
Your corrupt and criminal background...

187
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,404
...until you were caught and the CIA
blackmailed you into working for them.

188
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,049
But what interests me,
given your profile...

189
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,882
...is what would motivate you to become
the CIA's most effective agent.

190
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,401
I concluded it must be...

191
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,484
...to counteract the humiliation
of knowing your balls...

192
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,247
...are at the end of a very long leash
held by a very short man.

193
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,245
I'm sure you understand humiliation.
Better than most.

194
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,640
Really?

195
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,403
- How so?
- Well, after your performance last night...

196
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,211
...I thought I should read up on you.

197
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,001
Rather a sad story, what with your dad
being a big pal of Stalin's...

198
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,528
...and a top government official
with all the perks and privileges...

199
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,650
...right up until he was caught
embezzling party funds.

200
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,087
How old were you
when he was sent to the Gulag?

201
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,687
Ten?

202
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,604
Eleven years old?

203
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,281
Was that when the psychotic
episodes started?

204
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,968
You did, however, rise above it.

205
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,406
Special forces. KGB.

206
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,281
The youngest man to join, in fact,
and their best within three years.

207
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,331
I do wonder if it was your father's shame
that gave you such drive, though.

208
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,811
Or...

209
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,284
...was it your mother's reputation?

210
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,243
I understand that she was...

211
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,210
...extremely popular
amongst your father's friends...

212
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,966
...after he was shipped off to Siberia.

213
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,326
America is teaming up with Russia.

214
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,327
Is this a joke?

215
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,324
It should tell you
how important this mission is.

216
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,005
To everyone.

217
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,928
I'm not going back behind that Wall.

218
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,171
And at the end of this,
that's what they'll want.

219
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,130
You don't have to go anywhere
that you don't want to go.

220
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,520
You're the star of this show...

221
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,001
My woman would never wear
anything like that.

222
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,491
What's he doing here?

223
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,720
I told you, we're teaming up
with the Russians.

224
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,207
Doesn't get any more Russian
than the Red Peril here.

225
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,169
And why did he call me his woman?

226
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,524
Because I am now your fiancé.

227
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,325
No, no, no.

228
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,211
No!

229
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,043
Smoothly done.

230
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,049
Gaby. Gaby. Wait.

231
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,123
Give me a minute to explain.

232
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,406
It's your cover.

233
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,571
He's an architect designing a resort for
heroes of the Soviet Union by the Black Sea.

234
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,803
The Russian Minister of Culture has
a weakness for classical architecture...

235
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
...and he's sending your man there
to Rome to study.

236
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,127
He's also managed to secure a visa
for his fiancée.

237
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,006
And, naturally, you'd introduce him
to your beloved Uncle Rudi.

238
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,684
And what about you? What's your cover?

239
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,845
Jack Deveny. Antiquities dealer,
specializing in Greek and Roman sculpture.

240
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,249
The Vinciguerra family happen to have
one of the finest collections in the world.

241
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,770
You're asking too much of me.

242
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,410
You'll do fine.

243
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,571
No.

244
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,049
- These dresses are all in your size.
- Excuse me?

245
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,643
Soviet architect traveling to Rome...

246
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,849
...would never dress his woman
in the clothes you tried to put her in.

247
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,767
You tried to dress her like someone
on your side thinks...

248
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,524
...someone dress
behind the Iron Curtain.

249
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,364
She's from behind the Iron Curtain.

250
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,409
That doesn't mean
she want to bring it with her.

251
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,562
We need two purses, please.
An everyday and clutch.

252
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,767
And grab that belt.

253
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,770
Uh, no.

254
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,689
No, not the Dior, the Rabanne.

255
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,208
You can't put a Paco Rabanne belt
on a Patou.

256
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,408
- She's not going to wear a Patou.
- What's wrong with a Patou?

257
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,403
Nothing. If you're fat.

258
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,130
The Dior goes with the Rabanne.

259
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,801
It won't match.

260
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,243
It doesn't have to match.

261
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,368
Have you seen the price of this handbag?

262
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,608
It costs more than my car.

263
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,043
You can get back
on your horse now, cowboy.

264
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,802
I'll see you in Rome.

265
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,491
Not bad.

266
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,888
I like this. Yes.

267
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,321
But it's missing...

268
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,331
...a little something.

269
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,164
Now we are engaged.

270
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,325
Congratulations.

271
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,364
- Enjoy your stay, Mr. Waverly.
- I hope so.

272
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,042
Jack Deveny. Checking in.

273
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,726
- Welcome to Rome, Mr. Deveny.
- Thank you.

274
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,649
I have a quick errand to run.

275
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,802
Could you have my bag taken
to my room, please?

276
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,361
- Of course.
- Thank you.

277
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,567
Luigi.

278
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,044
Where are we going?

279
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,406
The same place every architect goes
when they visit Rome.

280
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,724
To see the sights.

281
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,325
Mm.

282
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,926
So, Mr. Architect...

283
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,562
...I'm sure you've done your homework.

284
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,771
Why don't you tell me a bit
about the Steps.

285
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,321
Good question.

286
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,041
The Steps were constructed in 1723...

287
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,603
...credited to two Italian architects.

288
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,363
Really, built by Russian.

289
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,602
Sergei Ivanov.

290
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,730
Now, Sergei also had mother, Yagoda...

291
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,565
...who introduced him
to classical architecture...

292
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,291
...and whom he revered as his muse.

293
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,764
Unfortunately for Sergei, his mother died
in the middle of construction.

294
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,201
So in memory of his beloved Yagoda...

295
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,284
...he make one step
to celebrate every year...

296
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,283
...of his mother's life.

297
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,408
So she died at 135.

298
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,047
No. She died at 100.

299
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,725
He was 35.

300
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,962
So 135 steps.

301
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,290
Impressive.

302
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,084
So she gave birth at the age of 65?

303
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,727
No.

304
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,645
I...

305
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,481
Evening, comrade.

306
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,722
You're not supposed
to be making contact in public.

307
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,121
- You're being followed.
- I know.

308
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,567
Two men from hotel lobby. Mid-30s.
One in brown suit.

309
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,121
Other in leather jacket,
which is why you should leave.

310
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,567
They diverted
when you turned down the Steps.

311
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,529
So I imagine
they'll be waiting ahead for you.

312
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,606
I will handle them.

313
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,245
"Handle"?

314
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,162
Just to avoid any confusion, you do mean
give them your wallet and act scared?

315
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,401
"Scared"?

316
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,841
- What's going on?
- You're being tested.

317
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,446
Someone is trying to make sure
that your fiance is really an architect...

318
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,080
...and not someone
who's trained how to fight.

319
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,605
KGB agent, for example.

320
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,762
I said, you are not needed here.

321
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,361
I think you should do as he says.

322
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,611
And remember:

323
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,125
Take it like a pussy.

324
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,850
This is not the Russian way.

325
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,521
Nice shoes.

326
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,366
Thank you.

327
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,809
Perhaps you give them to me.

328
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,528
I think your feet are a little small.

329
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,365
Then give me some money for coffee.

330
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,880
Hmm?

331
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,405
Dearest...

332
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,560
...give the gentlemen something for coffee.

333
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,008
Enjoy your coffee.

334
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,041
Nice watch.

335
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,571
- Darling, give him the watch.
- And the ring.

336
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,204
Mm.

337
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,410
Thank you.

338
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,245
Give me the watch!

339
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,686
Give him the watch!

340
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,526
Illya.

341
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,284
Do as he says.

342
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,329
Calm down.

343
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,084
Not very good
at this whole subtlety thing, are you?

344
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,641
That man stole my father's watch.

345
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,609
Aren't you supposed
to be a Russian architect?

346
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,649
<i>Da,</i> but a Russian architect would fight.

347
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,723
Russian agent would've killed them both.

348
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,605
So it's no trouble unless you continue
to question my actions.

349
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,564
So you've actually thought this through.

350
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,603
Would you like
to finish what we started?

351
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,325
Don't!

352
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,165
You two are supposed
to be looking after me.

353
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,766
So why am I playing mother, huh?

354
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,968
Either you start to look like you know
what you're doing...

355
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,926
...or I'm out of here.

356
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,081
It's open.

357
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,807
Good evening, Mr. Deveny.

358
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,004
With the compliments of the hotel.

359
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,130
I apologize it wasn't brought up earlier.

360
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,047
Thank you very much.

361
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,362
Is there anything else I can do for you?

362
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,728
It's a fine bottle of champagne.
Be a shame to drink it alone.

363
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,051
Oh.

364
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,850
Uh...

365
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,571
I'm still on duty, Mr. Deveny.

366
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,487
Pity.

367
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,045
But my shift ends in five minutes.

368
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,724
I'm sure we can find something to do
for five minutes.

369
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,409
There's a party tomorrow
to celebrate the 50th anniversary...

370
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,881
...of Vinciguerra Shipping.

371
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,202
Uncle Rudi has invited us.

372
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,761
- Drink?
- No. Thank you.

373
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,009
Would you like bigger glass?

374
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,407
I will finish this bottle.

375
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,444
The only question is...

376
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,443
...are you gonna help me or not?

377
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,087
No. Thank you.

378
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,966
This is fun?

379
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,482
This is not good idea.

380
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,681
I am going to bed. Please turn this off.

381
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,603
No fun dancing by yourself.

382
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,929
I need a partner.

383
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,927
No.

384
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,840
"No," as you can't dance?

385
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,371
Or you don't want to?

386
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,965
We'll call it both.

387
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,201
Oop.

388
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,524
Clap.

389
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,409
And then...

390
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,407
So sorry.

391
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,047
Sorry.

392
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,401
All right, clap.

393
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,167
You're not in East German
chop shop anymore.

394
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,881
Still no drink?

395
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,410
Don't you make me put you
over my knee.

396
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,407
So you don't want to dance.

397
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,840
- But you want to wrestle.
- No, I did not say that.

398
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,211
Good night, little chop-shop girl.

399
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,241
This time...

400
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,522
...I do need to go.

401
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,125
That is disappointing.
Just another five minutes?

402
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,605
Heh. I know your five minutes, Mr. Deveny.

403
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,847
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

404
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,365
These...

405
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,406
...are...

406
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,245
...Russian...

407
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,601
...made.

408
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,485
One second.

409
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,251
These...

410
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,481
...are...

411
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,165
...American...

412
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,606
...made.

413
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,601
And very low-tech.

414
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,285
That bow tie doesn't work with that suit.

415
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,245
Good morning.

416
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,605
I enjoyed last night.

417
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,242
Is better for the mission that we get
to know each other little bit more...

418
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,481
...intimately.

419
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,125
What does that mean?

420
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,489
It means I like my woman strong. Come.

421
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,041
Come on.

422
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,565
Maybe I get you present.

423
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,485
Mm.

424
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,887
Mm.

425
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,969
Heh. Pump the brakes, my Russian friend.

426
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,248
We might be engaged,
but I'm my own woman.

427
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,926
Besides, I wouldn't be wearing
my engagement ring.

428
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,651
Remember? It's only just been stolen.

429
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,691
Your fiancé would have gone out
first thing in the morning to replace it.

430
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,211
Now we are engaged. Again.

431
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,763
After you, fiancée.

432
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,325
<i>Alexander Vinciguerra...</i>

433
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,647
Unh.

434
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,524
Beg your pardon.

435
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,330
Excuse me, sir? Excuse me?

436
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,240
Sir? Excuse me, sir?

437
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,401
Your invitation?

438
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,204
Of course.

439
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,764
I wonder, did I leave it in the Jag?

440
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,604
Could you please come with me, sir?

441
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,762
I'm sure we can clear this up.

442
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,762
What are you doing?

443
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,569
- Why on earth would you do that?
- He doesn't have an invitation.

444
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,088
- Are you okay?
- Thank you. Thank you.

445
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,526
I wonder what they do to people
without invitations.

446
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,725
I'm Victoria Vinciguerra.
I do believe an apology is in order.

447
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,489
- I'll take it from here.
- Thank you.

448
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,961
Oh.

449
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,127
I'm okay, I think.

450
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,169
Is this beautiful woman I hardly recognize
my favorite niece?

451
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,920
Gaby.

452
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,727
It's been too long.

453
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,491
You are a miracle worker, sir.

454
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,086
I want to hear all about how
you managed to get her out.

455
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,364
Jack Deveny.

456
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,805
Yes, please.

457
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,450
Tell me, how does a Russian architect meet
a German car mechanic in East Berlin?

458
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,844
It started when I was brought out...

459
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,202
...to make improvements
on 9 kilometers of the Wall.

460
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,601
- Mm.
- And one morning, I was coming home...

461
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,881
He rear-ended a tank.

462
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,965
That is when I met the most expensive
mechanic in East Germany.

463
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,805
And did they make you build the Wall
as well as design it?

464
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,565
You're shaped like a powerlifter,
not an architect.

465
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,641
I like to jog.

466
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,406
How did you get the invitation to my party?

467
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,483
Before we get there...

468
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,771
...allow me.

469
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,202
Contessa's a little heavy
with the lipstick.

470
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,808
And you're a little light
with your fingers.

471
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,041
Well, I doubt she'll miss it.

472
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,410
Etruscan, isn't it?

473
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,210
Oh.

474
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,771
May I?

475
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,085
If you don't, there could be trouble.

476
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,406
What about my watch?

477
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,924
Are we in a rush?

478
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,841
No, I don't suppose we are.

479
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,527
Now, tell me,
when did this happy accident occur?

480
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,286
Two years ago.

481
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,684
- Two years ago?
- Yes.

482
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,286
You never wrote
your Uncle Rudi a word about it.

483
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,525
- I wanted to make sure it was serious.
- Or were you, perhaps, ashamed?

484
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,523
Why would she be ashamed?

485
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,810
I know that the equity of aristocratic blood
is not appreciated by most communists.

486
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,450
But a good German girl knows...

487
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:06,209
...never to mix the blood of a racehorse
with that of a carthorse.

488
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,682
Uncle Rudi?
That's not a very nice thing to say.

489
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,127
Don't be so protective.

490
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,842
I'm sure our weightlifter
can defend himself.

491
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,286
Excuse me.

492
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,965
Mm.

493
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,921
So you're a thief.

494
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,562
I like to call myself a specialist
in complicated acquisitions.

495
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,485
- I hope you wear a mask.
- Sometimes.

496
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,529
Just never when I'm stealing things.

497
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,042
What is it exactly that you think
you can do for me, Mr. Jack?

498
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,282
Let's just say I fill gaps...

499
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,044
...in important collections.

500
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,569
Those one or two special pieces
that are impossible to acquire...

501
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,643
...without the requisite skill set.

502
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,885
Victoria, this is my Gaby.

503
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,805
- The famous niece.
- Hello.

504
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,685
I need to use the sink.

505
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,729
So use the ladies'.

506
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,407
Go ahead.

507
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,723
- What brings you to Rome, Mr. Deveny?
- Just here to see the sights.

508
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,929
- Rudi. Nice to see you.
- Ah, Waverly.

509
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,924
Waverly runs the shipping department
at British Oil.

510
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,082
Excuse me, I said I need to use the sink.

511
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,085
- What?
- I am sorry I'm so late, Rudi.

512
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,242
I stupidly seem to have lost my invitation.

513
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,927
Jack Deveny.

514
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,321
Yes. Yes, I think we bumped
into each other outside.

515
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,886
Beg your pardon.

516
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,610
- I do apologize.
- No, not at all.

517
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,444
I noticed you're very good
with your hands.

518
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,370
- Excuse me?
- He said, "Use the ladies'."

519
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,285
I witnessed your trick
with the tablecloth.

520
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,841
That's brilliant.
Were you once a waiter or...?

521
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,882
Have the jets been cleansed
and totally rechecked for size and flow?

522
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,442
Oh, really? You want to fix it?

523
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,649
I'd be delighted.

524
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,048
So I just need the wrench.

525
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,483
I'd better give the Contessa
back her bracelet.

526
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,120
Why don't you pop
into the office tomorrow morning.

527
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,807
We can talk more about filling
in my gaps.

528
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,803
I'll try not to disappoint.

529
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,486
You see, each one of us has a destiny.

530
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,251
And I believe I can help you with yours.

531
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,649
You can see the future?

532
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,280
I can see us having lunch tomorrow.

533
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,966
Alone.

534
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,840
Darling, time to go. Sorry.

535
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,526
- Darling, I'll be a minute.
- Now.

536
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,930
What are you doing?

537
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,525
Another time, perhaps.

538
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,162
- Leaving so soon?
- Illya isn't feeling very well.

539
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,127
But we've had a wonderful time.
Thank you, Uncle Rudi.

540
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,680
Where's Peril?

541
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,247
He's been in there half an hour.

542
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,520
You've been spending a lot of time
in bathrooms recently.

543
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,524
Apparently, you put someone
called Count Lippi in a hospital.

544
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,205
He had soft bones.

545
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,006
- And don't question my methods.
- What's he done?

546
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,767
Super Agent here had some fun
with three Italian boys in the men's room.

547
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,967
They had it coming.

548
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,730
You need to control your temper.

549
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,564
Your new boyfriend is a Nazi.

550
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,563
How did you find Alexander Vinciguerra?

551
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,246
I think he's an athletic,
good-looking gazillionaire...

552
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,404
...who's offered me a job
and made advances towards me.

553
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,244
Still a Nazi.

554
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,721
I quite like him.

555
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,922
Yes, but is he up to no good?

556
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,846
If you mean by "no good," is he trying
to steal me away from my fiancé?

557
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,960
- The answer's yes.
- That's not happening.

558
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,930
I don't know what you're upset about.
You're not even my fiancé.

559
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,883
As far as he is concerned, I am.

560
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,929
And for the purpose of the mission, I am.

561
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,050
So, like I said, it's not happening.

562
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,287
Look at this.

563
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,284
This film I'm using has been treated
to be sensitive to gamma radiation.

564
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,800
These blurred lines means
they've been in close proximity...

565
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,888
...to radioactive material
in last 24 hours...

566
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,610
...which means they have succeeded
in enriching the uranium.

567
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,605
We need to move quicker.

568
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,330
Tell you what.

569
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,360
I'm gonna go sleep on this.

570
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,480
- Is this what you call sleeping on it?
- I suppose you're responsible for the lights.

571
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,244
You're welcome.

572
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,770
The thing is...

573
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,446
...I work better alone.

574
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,965
I work better alone too.

575
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,169
I'm not leaving.

576
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,211
We have approximately 10 minutes
before the power comes back on.

577
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,920
Want to sit around and talk about it...

578
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,048
Okay. I'll let you tag along.

579
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,680
But it's in and out, no mess,
so nobody knows we've been here.

580
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,524
And we both forget about it
in the morning.

581
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,531
Okay.

582
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,681
What is that?

583
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,002
Super-hardened boron sharpened
with a CO2 laser.

584
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,850
Mm.

585
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,530
CO2 laser.

586
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,887
Coming?

587
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,524
- I take top.
- I'll take the bottom.

588
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,721
Problem?

589
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,403
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Yes. Be quiet.

590
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,810
Just let me do it.

591
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,084
Pfft.

592
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,891
Shall we?

593
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,731
Loving your work, Peril.

594
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,521
You do the labs, I'll take the floor.

595
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,527
Meet me on the gantry in five minutes.

596
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,964
Try not to get lost.

597
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,250
I didn't find anything.

598
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,526
Wait.

599
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,521
Why?

600
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,523
I thought that was my father's watch.
Make mistake.

601
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,682
And, uh, what exactly did you do to him?

602
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,162
At KGB, we call it "the kiss."
It takes years to master.

603
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,687
Although he's standing upright,
he's completely unconscious.

604
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,724
He'll be like this for 20 minutes.
Can't touch.

605
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,441
Generator's back on.

606
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,761
Why do you think they have radiation tools
and suit in a satellite factory?

607
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,010
Next to hidden button.

608
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,724
We wouldn't have found that
without my father's watch.

609
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,409
Want to have a go?

610
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,563
Be my guest.

611
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,565
Hold this.

612
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,931
And these.

613
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,841
Uh, open these.

614
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,610
This...

615
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,286
...is a Swiss-built...

616
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,125
...Vortbinder-Lanszmann...

617
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,084
...7010 model.

618
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,208
It has dual combination locks...

619
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,283
...triple return rotators...

620
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,968
...and synchronized cylinders.

621
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,441
The earlier models...

622
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,965
...had a design flaw.

623
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,286
It's a flaw I intend to exploit.

624
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,725
Still...

625
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,409
...very difficult to open.

626
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,803
But it's not...

627
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,727
...impossible.

628
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,604
And the flaw was...

629
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,411
...people who designed this model...

630
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,131
...are not very good...

631
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,201
...at stealing things.

632
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,170
I, however...

633
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,486
...am.

634
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,370
- Did you deactivate alarm?
- Model 7010 doesn't have an alarm.

635
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,803
Loving your work, cowboy.

636
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,045
Let's go!

637
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,210
Does this mean anything to you?

638
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,961
It's part of centrifuge
for refining uranium.

639
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,726
- I am not staying here.
- Where are you gonna go?

640
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,166
Swimming.

641
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,205
We've got three exits
and two of them are closed!

642
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,521
I would recommend turning
before you hit that wall!

643
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,444
The last thing I need is your help!

644
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,451
You're not gonna make it.

645
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,762
Just shut up and watch me work.

646
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,484
Hold on, cowboy.

647
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,930
Hmm.

648
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,564
Keep quiet.

649
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,401
Follow me.

650
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,801
Mr. Deveny's room, please.

651
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,891
Hello?

652
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,445
Gaby.

653
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,008
Room 304, please.

654
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,529
The meeting is confirmed.

655
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,650
Sorry, Mrs. Vinciguerra,
there's no answer.

656
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,006
Key.

657
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,084
What's going on?

658
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,886
Where's my case?

659
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,527
Hello, Victoria.

660
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,167
Grape?

661
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,084
You've bugged him?

662
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,083
He tried to bug me.

663
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,925
He doesn't sound like he needs your help.

664
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,600
You sure Victoria believed you?

665
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,603
I gave it everything I had.

666
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,770
Believe me.

667
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,645
I also got another meeting
with her later today.

668
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,286
So, what, we just let Gaby go
with Uncle Rudi?

669
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,728
If there's a chance he'll lead us
to her father, do we have a choice?

670
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,769
This could be like leading lamb
to slaughter.

671
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,201
Going soft, Peril?

672
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,364
What you talking about?

673
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,965
- Good morning.
- Morning.

674
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,926
Your tracker's not sending a signal.

675
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,241
Have you turned it on?

676
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,210
I think so.

677
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,925
Or do you want to check it?

678
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,287
Be my guest.

679
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,650
It's your tracker.

680
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,644
You're the expert.
I'll be on the balcony.

681
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,005
They're still cold.

682
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,045
Sorry.

683
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,681
What are you doing down there?

684
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,888
Trying not to get lost.

685
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,530
- You're trembling.
- That's because I'm scared.

686
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,369
It's going to be okay.

687
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,369
How do you know?

688
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,130
I'll be-

689
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,284
I'll be close by.

690
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,483
All turned on now?

691
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,570
Uncle Rudi's car has arrived.

692
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,365
Are you ready?

693
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,286
So your Uncle Rudi thinks
we should have a little chat.

694
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,771
I know my father is here.

695
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,443
And that he works for you.

696
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,481
And how is that?

697
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,805
Simple.

698
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,443
I think I need to make a telephone call.

699
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,530
Perhaps you've come to us
at a fortuitous time, Miss Teller.

700
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,365
Your father's work ethic has been,
as of late, somewhat lacking.

701
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,921
Your presence will provide
the necessary motivation.

702
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,848
You leave my father to me.

703
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,009
Madame Vinciguerra will be
with you shortly.

704
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,322
She would like it
if you make yourself comfortable.

705
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,331
Thank you.

706
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,365
Help yourself to a drink.

707
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,686
So sorry to keep you waiting.

708
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,650
You don't look like you slept much
last night, Mr. Deveny.

709
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,846
Funny you should say that,
Madame Vinciguerra.

710
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,401
Don't think this Scotch is helping either.

711
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,926
If I were a suspicious man,
I would say you put something in my drink.

712
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,242
It's much easier to trust a drink
you fixed yourself.

713
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,562
But how did you know
I was gonna drink the Scotch?

714
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,088
I didn't. I laced all the drinks.

715
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,242
I don't like to leave much to chance...

716
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,125
...Mr. Solo.

717
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,529
- I thought I was doing so well.
- Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.

718
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,441
You were doing fantastically well.

719
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,922
The fault doesn't lie
in your performance.

720
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,930
However, you couldn't control
the loyalty of young Gaby.

721
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,771
She gave you up like an unwanted kitten.

722
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,486
I know my father is here.
And that he works for you.

723
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,687
And how is that?

724
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,605
Simple.

725
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,441
My fiancé's a KGB agent.

726
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,968
And the American your wife has
been entertaining is with the CIA.

727
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,886
<i>The Russians and Americans thought
they were using me...</i>

728
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,486
...but I was using them to get to you.

729
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,051
Really?

730
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,883
She seemed so innocent.

731
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,883
You're not the first man to have fallen...

732
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,088
<i>...for the charms of a pretty, young woman.</i>

733
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,044
It's a tracking device.

734
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,810
He's probably out there in the woods.

735
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,440
<i>Watching us right now.</i>

736
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,565
<i>I'm sure my...</i>

737
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,247
...fiancé can confirm everything I've said.

738
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,481
If you can catch him.

739
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,802
I think I need to make a telephone call.

740
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,490
What are you doing?

741
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,091
I've been here before.

742
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,846
And last time, I fell rather badly
and hurt my head.

743
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,164
I'm afraid that isn't going
to stop you getting hurt.

744
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,329
Sleep well, Napoleon.

745
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,682
Only my mother calls me Napoleon.

746
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,848
Mummy says hello.

747
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,805
You may have heard of the Dark Angel
of Ravensberg...

748
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,725
...the Butcher of Belsen...

749
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,211
...and my personal favorite:

750
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,204
the Fifth Horseman,
Doctor of the Apocalypse.

751
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:30,091
What history has failed to relate is
that this was not three individuals...

752
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,881
...but the tireless work
of a single artist.

753
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,042
And today, you have the privilege...

754
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:39,403
...of experiencing his work firsthand.

755
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,371
Hello again, Mr. Solo.

756
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,087
My apologies.

757
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,245
There's a short in the wiring.

758
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,686
I thought I'd located it.

759
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,684
I keep telling the maestro
to modernize, but alas...

760
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,410
...he's a hopeless sentimentalist.

761
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,528
We have contact.

762
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,041
My apologies.

763
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,446
Won't happen again.

764
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,924
So sorry I can't stay to
finish you off myself.

765
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,851
Rudi's never in a rush, but sadly, I am.

766
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,691
And I want it to be slow.

767
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,242
I'll send your regards to little Gaby.

768
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,327
Once upon a time,
there was a little boy.

769
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,171
You wouldn't describe him...

770
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,484
...as a particularly special little boy.

771
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,929
He was neither tall nor handsome,
charismatic or amusing.

772
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,687
In fact, he appeared
to be exceedingly dull.

773
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,049
Because of this boy's
apparent shortcomings...

774
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,009
...he was bullied mercilessly...

775
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,606
...and relentlessly by the other children.

776
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,561
Year merged with miserable year...

777
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,121
...as life continued to be a living hell.

778
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,691
But what the other boys didn't understand
about their victim was...

779
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,491
...that he didn't see them as enemies.

780
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,681
He saw them as instruments of learning.

781
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,045
A priceless lesson was gleaned
from his tormentors.

782
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,731
Man...

783
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,443
...has only two masters in this world.

784
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,365
And their names are Pain and Fear.

785
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,331
The boy found...

786
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:08,042
...he had quite a talent for eliciting
these feelings in others.

787
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,371
So on the principle of playing
to your strengths...

788
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,929
...he decided to make their cultivation
his life's work.

789
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,769
Fortunately for this boy...

790
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,721
...history gave him
an unprecedented opportunity.

791
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,840
A world war.

792
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:40,926
The canvas...

793
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,650
...Mr. Solo...

794
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,322
...on which he would produce
his greatest work.

795
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,405
You will go here, Mr. Solo.

796
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,931
A whole page just for you.

797
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,291
And not in black and white,
like the others. No.

798
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,210
Kodachrome.

799
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,446
The colors are so real,
you can almost taste them.

800
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,801
Ready?

801
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,363
There are two kinds of...

802
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,602
...torture, Mr. Solo.

803
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,730
One is for the extraction of information.

804
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,651
The other...

805
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,282
...is for its own sake.

806
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,411
I must admit this does get frustrating.

807
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,881
Ah! But fortunately...

808
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,806
...I'm in an old-fashioned mood.

809
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,326
I think we'll start...

810
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,170
...with the pliers.

811
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,166
I never thought I'd say this.

812
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,561
I'm actually quite pleased to see you.

813
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,969
You doing okay, cowboy?

814
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,730
- I thought I found all your trackers.
- You did.

815
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,609
Just not the ones in your shoes.

816
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,206
Do you mind?

817
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:45,001
You don't have to do things to me to make
me talk. I'll tell you everything I know.

818
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,049
You won't be able to stop me.

819
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,885
- What about Gaby?
- She betrayed you. I will testify.

820
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,405
Don't kick yourself.

821
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,688
- She fooled me too.
- It's not the same.

822
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,281
- They have a glitch.
- Then I'll fix it.

823
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,601
Wait. Please, wait.

824
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,001
- Do you still have Teller?
- Yes.

825
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,208
Has he succeeded
in enriching the uranium?

826
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,850
Oh, we are way beyond that.

827
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,526
There's already a bomb,
a nuclear warhead.

828
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:16,370
The Reichsmarschall will take delivery
tomorrow morning at 8:00.

829
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,726
They're sending a submarine.

830
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,288
Between that time and now,
it is being held...

831
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,444
...on Vinciguerra Island,
the family's private retreat.

832
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,649
I'll appear in court.
I'll inform on anyone.

833
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,644
I don't even need to know them. Heh.

834
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,131
I'm yours to command.

835
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,449
Will you give us a minute?

836
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,485
Don't go anywhere.

837
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,810
I'll be right here.

838
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,921
What should we do?

839
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,845
- We have to get to that island.
- What should we do with him?

840
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,807
It's your call.

841
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,281
You're the one
he's been having fun with.

842
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,251
On the one hand...

843
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,165
...we need him,
he's a world of information.

844
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,049
But on the other hand...

845
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,043
...I know exactly what'll happen.

846
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,362
He'll strike a deal and struggle out of it.

847
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:16,320
He's prepared to sell his ass on this,
and for that, they'll give him his freedom.

848
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,811
He'll be out within months.

849
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,761
Or worse. They'll offer him a job.

850
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,210
A man with that skill set's
never wanting for employment.

851
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:28,331
- So, what do you think we should do?
- Just give me a minute.

852
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,565
Huh.

853
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,609
He fixed the glitch.

854
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,371
Damn.

855
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,569
I left my jacket in there.

856
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,890
I'll let you two get reacquainted.

857
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,767
Okay.

858
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,206
Thank you.

859
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,691
That got their attention.

860
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,525
They'll have chopper waiting for us
at airport.

861
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,165
Gaby.

862
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,567
Mr. Solo. We meet again.

863
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,210
Mr. Kuryakin. My name's Waverly.

864
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,806
I believe your instructions are
to follow me, so...

865
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,651
...follow me.

866
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,927
Very well done, my darling.

867
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,809
They will send an army to stop us.

868
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,281
Then we must give them
an appropriate welcome.

869
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,761
<i>The line is secured.
You're now connected, sir.</i>

870
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,161
You will report to Commander Waverly...

871
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,767
<i>...of British Naval Intelligence
for the remainder of the mission.</i>

872
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:36,123
It is vital you retrieve Dr. Teller
and the computer disk.

873
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,246
<i>They are the key to the U.S. of A.
winning the arms race.</i>

874
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,402
Kill the Russian, if necessary.

875
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,089
Gentlemen, can you hear me?

876
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,166
Well, now if the Nazis are due
to take delivery...

877
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,522
...of this bomb at 0800, that gives us...

878
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,845
...a luxurious 14 hours in which
to seize the island, secure the warhead...

879
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,526
...and winkle out poor Professor Teller.

880
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:12,321
There is also, of course, the, uh,
small matter of retrieving my agent.

881
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,209
- You have British agent in this?
- Well, she's not British.

882
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,249
- "She"?
- Here we go.

883
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,448
I'm starting to smell the irony.

884
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,284
Gaby's working for you, isn't she?

885
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,044
Well done, Solo, yep, yeah.

886
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,531
You got there in the end.

887
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,083
My father has been unwell.

888
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,847
That and the stress led to self-doubt.
He's ready now to resume his work.

889
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,646
- A daughter's touch.
- Gaby has agreed to assist me.

890
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,366
To assure I finish in time.

891
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,129
- Now that is a good idea.
- You're wrong.

892
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,204
The thing is, Kuryakin,
when Professor Teller disappeared...

893
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,081
...we assumed his Nazi colleagues would
come knocking at his daughter's door...

894
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,208
...so we recruited her, and waited.

895
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,567
And what we got, of course, was you two.

896
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,042
I've been meaning to thank you very much
for nearly fouling up two years of my work.

897
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,601
You're wrong.
I saw her betray us at Vinciguerra.

898
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,524
Yes. I told her to.

899
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,450
The meeting is confirmed.

900
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,682
<i>I think you know what you have to do.</i>

901
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,760
<i>You were about to be exposed, Kuryakin.</i>

902
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,484
<i>The only way she could stay in the game.</i>

903
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,369
<i>She knew the ring
you gave her was bugged...</i>

904
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,443
<i>...and you'd be listening
to every word she said.</i>

905
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,931
If you can catch him.

906
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,242
<i>Give the average agent time to escape...</i>

907
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,566
...and you are not average,
are you, Kuryakin? You're special.

908
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,449
Let me translate this into English.

909
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,968
You told Gaby to drop us in it,
so you could find her father first.

910
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:52,125
But now you've lost her, so you need us
to help find her and finish the job.

911
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,124
Well, that is a very poor translation,
Solo, but...

912
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:59,645
Well, in a nutshell, yes, please,
thank you very much.

913
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,200
I think it's rather nice.

914
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,007
We're obviously all very fond of Gaby
and now we have a chance to save her, so...

915
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,483
Terrific. We're a little early.

916
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,802
What is that?

917
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,167
It's an aircraft carrier, Kuryakin.

918
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,729
For a special agent, you're not having
a very special day, are you?

919
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,289
Reflector lens.

920
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,001
So, what does that do?

921
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,845
Well, it's known as a coupler.

922
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,968
It sends a signal
which enables another missile...

923
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,600
...to lock onto this one
for double the impact.

924
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,451
It's left over from when this was a warhead
that contained conventional explosives.

925
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,321
Now that we are converting it to nuclear,
it's redundant.

926
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,331
I'm sorry.

927
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,284
We're nearly done, Victoria.

928
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,171
Those are the words
we've been waiting to hear.

929
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,371
- What are you doing?
- Let's stop playing games, shall we?

930
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,770
Put her in a cell.

931
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,367
If you don't hear from me
in 20 minutes, kill her.

932
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,049
That's how long you have to finish this.

933
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,561
You can start by putting back
the correct lens, professor.

934
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,722
<i>So Vinciguerra Island.</i>

935
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,009
The plot is, and stop me
if I get this wrong, Jockelson...

936
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,202
...a stealth attack on the island
from the sea.

937
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,409
We shall go in through the front door
here at the harbor.

938
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:42,087
Jockelson and his men will get you
in there and keep the enemy entertained.

939
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,321
The rest is up to you.

940
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,087
It's done.

941
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,444
And with three minutes to spare.

942
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,845
The computer disk
with your research on it. Where is it?

943
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,603
And the backup.

944
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,725
What about Gaby?

945
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,803
She'll be joining you shortly.

946
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,408
Looks like we found Dr. Teller.

947
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,846
The bomb was here.

948
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,685
Hmm.

949
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,041
Illya, come in.

950
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,247
I'm here.

951
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,051
<i>Alexander has Gaby and the bomb.
They're at the entrance.</i>

952
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,125
Illya!

953
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:49,920
Hold on!

954
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,164
Solo!

955
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,285
Cowboy.

956
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,680
I'll be okay, Peril.

957
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,525
It's okay.

958
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,731
Well done, chaps.

959
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,330
Just one small snag.

960
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,121
Wrong warhead.

961
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,645
So it's a decoy.

962
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,646
No, no, no, it's a real bomb.
Quite a nasty one too.

963
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,485
But not nuclearized.
There's no uranium in it.

964
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,161
There was a second warhead in the lab.

965
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,324
Did you check everything I asked?

966
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,084
Radar, sonar, aerial patrols...

967
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:37,449
...all report no other vehicles
have left this island since last night.

968
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,690
That includes submarines.

969
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,002
What about fishing boats leaving
the mainland?

970
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:44,481
The boats go out every morning at dawn.

971
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,200
I saw them. How many of them are there?

972
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,127
Almost 100.

973
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,163
They are spread out over
a 60-kilometer radius by now.

974
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,362
And that radius is expanding every minute.

975
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,931
We don't even know
which boat we're looking for.

976
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,727
<i>Rumor has it that Sergio Vinciguerra...</i>

977
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,442
<i>...who was responsible for smuggling
the Nazis' gold to South America...</i>

978
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,045
<i>...at the end of the war...</i>

979
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,130
<i>...he died five years ago...</i>

980
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,682
<i>...having built Vinciguerra into one of the
biggest shipping companies in the world.</i>

981
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:18,128
<i>Submarine surfaces at 0800.</i>

982
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,044
Gives us 20 minutes, gentlemen.

983
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,201
<i>Diadema.</i>

984
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,967
That's Sergio Vinciguerra's
old fishing boat. I suggest we start there.

985
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,286
Can you get them on the radio?

986
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,970
You can get a bearing
from the radio signal, yes?

987
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,122
If we keep them broadcasting
for long enough.

988
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,681
I have an idea
which might make things quicker.

989
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,449
Ten minutes and counting.

990
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,361
Mr. Solo, this is your cue. Thank you.

991
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:23,369
<i>Diadema,</i> this is Napoleon Solo.

992
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:26,690
Hello, Victoria. I suspect
that you're already listening...

993
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,446
...so I'll give you this message directly.

994
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,045
Earlier today...

995
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,770
...I killed your husband.

996
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,564
We're wasting our time.
This isn't working.

997
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,649
If you could just shut up,
thank you very much.

998
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:40,921
Ramp it up, please, Solo.

999
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:45,768
I'd like to report that he died honorably,
courageously and selflessly.

1000
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,967
But he didn't.

1001
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:51,081
Instead, it was a rather pitiful affair
involving tears, begging...

1002
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,210
...and offers to trade anything
and, indeed, anyone...

1003
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,050
...so that I would spare his life.

1004
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,801
Napoleon.

1005
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,890
<i>I appreciate your message...</i>

1006
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,805
<i>...and now I hope you'll appreciate mine.</i>

1007
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,487
<i>Any blood relation of yours still living
will be dead within the year.</i>

1008
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:14,247
They will die slowly and painfully.

1009
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:18,041
<i>And you know from personal experience,
this is an area in which we excel.</i>

1010
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,611
Bearing 0-4-5, captain.

1011
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:22,531
There's nothing you'll be able to do
but witness their suffering...

1012
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:26,327
...as you await your own death,
which I will save for last.

1013
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,962
- This I vow on my husband's soul.
- All yours, captain. Thank you.

1014
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,930
Won't you have to inform
your organization to achieve that?

1015
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:36,004
After we deliver the warhead
you so desperately sought...

1016
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,969
...it will be the first item on my agenda.

1017
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:41,602
And you will die, Solo,
knowing you failed completely.

1018
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,649
<i>We have the professor's disk.</i>

1019
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:46,007
<i>We can build as many bombs as we need.</i>

1020
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,168
- Ready.
- Yes, proceed, please, captain.

1021
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,043
I see one flaw in that plan.

1022
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,049
Entertain me.

1023
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,521
While you've been telling me
how dangerous you are...

1024
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,682
...we've been locking on
to your radio signal.

1025
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,484
You can get a bearing from radio signal?

1026
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,324
If we keep them broadcasting long enough.

1027
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:08,120
- They're at 0-4-5, captain.
- All yours, captain. Thank you.

1028
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,400
Now we have your general location.

1029
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,331
It won't help you much.
I'll be gone in five minutes.

1030
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,124
<i>I haven't finished.</i>

1031
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:19,729
The coupling device that you so considerately
left us on your decoy warhead...

1032
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:21,405
...is accurate to 10 feet.

1033
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,688
I have an idea
which might make things quicker.

1034
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,046
It's known as a coupler.

1035
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,049
A signal, which enables another missile...

1036
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,402
...to lock onto this one
for double the impact.

1037
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,643
The coupling device is now activated,
and the bomb is armed.

1038
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,165
<i>That warhead...</i>

1039
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,560
<i>...although not nuclear...</i>

1040
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:40,647
<i>...shouldn't have any trouble obliterating
a medium-size fishing boat.</i>

1041
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,684
The aforementioned warhead launched...

1042
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:45,564
- Ready.
- Yes, proceed, please, captain.

1043
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,205
...45 seconds ago...

1044
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:53,404
...giving you about 30 seconds
until impact.

1045
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,329
<i>It won't trigger the nuclear warhead...</i>

1046
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,681
<i>...as that requires fission.</i>

1047
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,927
<i>So...</i>

1048
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,287
...if you do want to make good
on your vow...

1049
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,761
<i>...I suggest you abandon ship immediately.</i>

1050
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,729
How's that for entertainment?

1051
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,809
Very good.

1052
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,207
Well done, Solo.

1053
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:26,121
All packed?

1054
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,410
The bellboy is on his way up.

1055
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:33,809
It's time to go home. How about you?

1056
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,208
I'm not going back to East Germany.

1057
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,647
No, that is probably not a good idea
for a British spy.

1058
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,121
I'm sorry.

1059
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:49,960
I really wanted to tell you, but...

1060
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,561
It's okay.

1061
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,405
I would have done exactly
the same thing in your position.

1062
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:57,887
Mm.

1063
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,251
I'm sorry about your father.

1064
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,607
I lost him a long time ago.

1065
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,962
Cowboy's invited us for a drink up,
if you'd like.

1066
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,406
I have to see Waverly.

1067
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,171
In case we don't see each other again.

1068
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,367
No.

1069
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,330
You should keep it.

1070
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,641
As souvenir.

1071
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,651
That way I can keep track of you.

1072
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,721
Hello.

1073
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:33,451
Come in. Just finishing up.

1074
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,129
Fix us a couple of drinks.
I think we've earned them.

1075
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:42,164
I guess it's business as usual now.

1076
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,761
Back to how things were.

1077
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,650
Politics being what they are.

1078
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,605
You feeling okay?

1079
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,120
So, what now?

1080
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,049
Mission accomplished?

1081
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,446
Head back to Russia?

1082
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,450
Something like this.

1083
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,687
Yes.

1084
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,961
You?

1085
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,881
New York.

1086
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,726
Almost forgot.

1087
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,401
Got something for you.

1088
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,686
You know what my mission is?

1089
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,530
Same as mine was.

1090
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,249
Kill me if necessary...

1091
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,090
...to get that.

1092
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,767
Absolutely hated working with you, Peril.

1093
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,607
You're a terrible spy, Cowboy.

1094
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,926
Good evening, gentlemen.

1095
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,727
Rather touching scene.

1096
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,360
Nice view, glass of whiskey...

1097
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,205
...and a little bonfire to keep you warm.

1098
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:57,086
Rather good idea.

1099
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,364
So I have news.

1100
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,406
A fresh little unpleasantness has arisen.

1101
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,884
I've spoken to your superiors,
and now that we're all such good friends...

1102
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,805
...they've kindly agreed to let me keep
the team together for a while.

1103
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,971
- We leave in an hour.
- Where we going?

1104
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,487
Istanbul, Kuryakin.

1105
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,642
You'll need your curly-wurly shoes.

1106
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,123
- Oh, and you have a new code name.
- Code name?

1107
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,084
Yes, rather a good one:

1108
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,281
U.N.C.L.E.
